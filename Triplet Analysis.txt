	// Absent obstacles, can go anywhere in his 3 x king region

	// graph spread model ? : use graph theory to find reachability in the presence of obstacles
	
	// blocking

pieces are blocked, whenever they can't be moved without another piece moving first
melee can be blocked, if the melee attack can't succeed without another movement, melee or cannon happening first.
